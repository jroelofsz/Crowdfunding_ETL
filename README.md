## Description

For this ETL mini project, we worked to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Setup

To run our project, please follow the instructions below.

1. Open the `ETL_Mini_Project.ipynb` notebook in your desired environment.
2. Run all of the cells in the notebook. Please make sure you have the required dependencies to run this. 
3. Once you have completed running the notebook, you can now move on to the `Resources/SQL/crowdfunding_db_schema.sql` file. 
    1. Open the file.
    2. Run the `CREATE DATABASE` line on its own.
    3. Run the subsequent `CREATE TABLE` lines.
    4. Import the 4 CSV files generated by the notebook to their respective tables.
    5. Run the `SELECT` statements to view the data imported into the tables.


If you would like to view the ERD of the database, this is located in `Resources/ERD/`.
